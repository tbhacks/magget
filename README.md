# pimags
Quick and dirty scripts for downloading issues of MagPi and Wireframe magazine.

Use ./mpget.sh to download MagPi issues, or ./wfget.sh to download Wireframe issues.
Both take an optional argument to a destination directory which will be created if it does not exist.
Otherwise they download to the working directory.

There may be bugs, the code may not be elegant or efficient, they may stop working if Raspberry Pi changes anything.
Use at your own risk.
